# ðŸ§¬ Adam

**Adam** â€” is an experimental C++ project implementing learning based on **genetic algorithms**. The system uses **random mutations** and **natural selection** to evolve a "population" of solutions, selecting the best units based on their `fitness`-status.

## ðŸ“Œ About project

Adam - models the evolution process: generates a set of solutions (units), randomly mutates them, evaluates them according to the fitness criterion, and then saves and develops the most successful ones.

This can be used as a basis for:
- optimization problems;
- unsupervised machine learning;
- artificial life simulations;
- experiments with evolutionary strategies.
