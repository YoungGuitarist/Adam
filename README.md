# ðŸ§¬ Adam

**Adam** â€” is an experimental C++ project implementing learning based on **genetic algorithms**. The system uses **random mutations** and **natural selection** to evolve a "population" of solutions, selecting the best units based on their `fitness`-status.

## ðŸ“Œ About project

Adam - models the evolution process: generates a set of solutions (units), randomly mutates them, evaluates them according to the fitness criterion, and then saves and develops the most successful ones.

This can be used as a basis for:
- optimization problems;
- unsupervised machine learning;
- artificial life simulations;
- experiments with evolutionary strategies.

## Loging
This project have loging function, that helping to check statisticks and genome of simulation

Example:
```txt
Current day: 0
Unit 0:
   Day of death: 0
   Current HP: -8
   Genome: 
      HP:42
      SPEED: 64
Unit 2:
   Day of death: 0
   Current HP: 0
   Genome: 
      HP:64
      SPEED: 42
------------------------------------------------------- 
```
